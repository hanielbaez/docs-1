# Configuration

Imagine sitting down in front of a blank Python file and yet again configuring your environment, importing Numpy, Matplotlib, and SciPy, just to start plotting some results. We aim to avoid that with HAS by making configuration

hCore is extremely flexible right out of the box, filled with optimizations and tools that make developing simulations easier than ever.

With the configuration tools available to you, you can:

* Set global variables which capture truths or assumptions about the state of your world with [Globals](basic-properties.md)
* Define the extents of the world using [Bounds and Wrapping](topology/bounds-and-wrapping.md)
* Change how agents interact with the borders of the simulation using [Wrapping Presets and Flags](topology/wrapping-presets-and-flags.md)
* Configure how distance functions work in different topologies using [Distance Functions](topology/distance-functions.md)

Play around with simulations in hIndex to get a feel for how these flags change simulation dynamics
