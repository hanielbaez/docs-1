# Configuration

Imagine having sit down in front of a blank Python file and yet again import Numpy, Matplotlib, and SciPy just to start plotting some results. With HASH, you're just a few configuration flags away from getting the key insights faster than you ever could before.

HASH Core is extremely flexible right out of the box, filled with optimizations and tools that make developing simulations easier than ever.

With the configuration tools available to you, you can:

* Set global variables which capture truths or assumptions about the state of your world with [Globals](basic-properties.md)
* Define the extents of the world using [Bounds and Wrapping](topology/bounds-and-wrapping.md)
* Change how agents interact with the borders of the simulation using [Wrapping Presets and Flags](topology/wrapping-presets-and-flags.md)
* Configure how distance functions work in different topologies using [Distance Functions](topology/distance-functions.md)

Play around with simulations in HASH Index to get a feel for how these flags change simulation dynamics
