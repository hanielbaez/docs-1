# Configuration

Imagine having sit down in front of another blank Python file and yet again import Numpy, Matplotlib, and SciPy just to start getting results plotted. With HASH, you're just a few configuration flags away from getting the key insights faster than you ever could before.

HASH Core is extremely flexible right out of the box, filled with optimizations and tools that make the model development process smoother than ever. However, you might want to flip a flag or two, and switch between functionality of core parts of the simulation. 

With the configuration tools available to you, you can:

* Set global variables for all agents to use with [Basic Properties](basic-properties.md)
* Define the extents of the world using [Bounds and Wrapping](topology/bounds-and-wrapping.md)
* Change how agents interact with the borders of the simulation using [Wrapping Presets and Flags](topology/wrapping-presets-and-flags.md)
* Configure how distance functions work in different topologies using [Distance Functions](topology/distance-functions.md)
