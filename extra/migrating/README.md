# Moving to HASH

One of the frequent questions we hear from users is “We want to use HASH because it’s free/fast, but we’ve already built a simulation in \[software x\]. How can we port it over to HASH?”. To help users with existing simulations on different platforms, we've created a series of examples to show you how to convert it to a HASH model.

We’ll share tips and techniques for the conversion process, walk you through example conversions, and compare and contrast different simulation software approaches. At the end of the series you'll understand how to move your simulation infrastructure on to HASH and leverage the power of HASH’s modern simulation engine to build scalable simulations in JavaScript, or Python.
