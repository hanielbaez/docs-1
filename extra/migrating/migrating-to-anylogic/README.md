# Migrating to AnyLogic

We’re going to start with AnyLogic. AnyLogic is a great piece of software with a storied history - over two decades of active use! - and the approach they’ve taken of an extensive visual programming library with object oriented methods is quite reasonable. We’re fans,  even if we’ve gone in a different direction with HASH. In this article we’ll discuss:

* At a high level, what principles should you follow when converting an AnyLogic simulation into a HASH simulation?
* What are the key paradigmatic differences between AnyLogic and HASH?
* Step by step how to convert an example simulation.

The example simulation we selected is the [Oil Supply Chain simulation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/192MY6ftxnaaeF-5YaM0Ok8BZItIzBrUb/view?usp=sharing), a neat model that demonstrates a transportation and supply chain network for delivering oil. [The finished HASH simulation is here](https://hash.ai/@hash/oil-supply-chain).
