# System Requirements

Certain HASH features rely on cutting-edge technology that may not be supported in every browser and on every platform. For whatever browser you choose to use, we recommend the latest and greatest version to ensure support. We have found the best performance and user experience on the latest Chrome release.

### Hardware Requirements

We recommend ensuring your device has at least 8GB of ram and a decent graphics card to create, run and explore most normal-sized simulations. If you stumble into performance issues, try using the "Run in Cloud" button \(coming soon\) in Core to offload the heavy-lifting and computation to HASH Cloud. Local simulations are great for 100-200 agents, but if your simulation is much larger than that, or the number of agents grows exponentially, HASH Cloud may be a better fit.
