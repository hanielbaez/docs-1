# Specs Requirements

Some features used in HASH are cutting-edge technology and may not be supported in every browser and on every platform.

For whatever browser you choose to use, we recommend the latest and greatest version to ensure support. We have found the best performance and user experiene on the latest Chrome release.

We also recommend 8GB of ram and a decent graphics card to make moderately intense simulations. Building simulations is no easy feat! If you stumble into performance issues, try using the "Run in Cloud" functionality or writing more performant behaviors. Local simulations are great for 100-200 agents, so if your simulation is large, that means it's computationally intensive.
