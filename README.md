# Overview

Welcome to [HASH](https://hash.ai), an end-to-end solution for quickly creating massive, rich, real-time simulations.

You can use HASH to build detailed, agent based simulations of [factories](https://hash.ai/@hash/warehouse-conveyor1), [business process](https://hash.ai/@hash/interconnected-call-center), [public policy decisions](https://hash.ai/@b/sir-infection-network-w-rapid-tests) - any and every type of complex system.

## Getting Started

{% hint style="success" %}
As a new user, the best way to learn HASH is to browse our [gallery of examples](https://hash.ai/models?categoryID=5dc3da74cc0cf804dcc66a5c&page=1&sort=popularity) to find simulations with interesting dynamics you can tinker with, and try your hand at the [Tutorials](https://docs.hash.ai/core/tutorials/)
{% endhint %}

If you've used simulation modeling software before, you might find that models in HASH are a little different to those you're used to seeing. We leverage composable [agents](anatomy-of-an-agent/) and [behaviors](behaviors/) to make it faster and easier for you to create realistic, well-calibrated simulations.

If you're new to agent-based modeling, or want to better understand how these concepts translate into HASH, read up on [the basics of agent-based modeling](agent-based-modeling-basics-1.md).

Quickly get started by playing with examples from the [hIndex](https://hash.ai/index) or carry on reading to learn more about the tools provided by the HASH platform.

## Community & Support

If you need help or support, check out the [community forum](https://community.hash.ai/) or [join our public Slack](https://hash.ai/slack) \(this tends to be the fastest means of getting help\). You can reach out to us directly via our [contact page](https://hash.ai/contact) if you need to speak with us directly.
