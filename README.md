# Overview

Welcome to [HASH](https://hash.ai), an end-to-end platform for quickly creating rich, massively parallelizable simulations.

{% hint style="success" %}
As a new user, the best way to learn HASH is to browse our [gallery of examples](https://hash.ai/index/search?categoryID=5dc3da74cc0cf804dcc66a5c) to find toy simulations with interesting dynamics you can tinker with
{% endhint %}

Simulations in HASH might be a bit different than what you're used to. We leverage the core concepts of agent based modeling - composable _agents_ and _behaviors**,**_ to make it faster and easier for you to study the complex dynamics of the problem you're trying to solve.

Read up on [Agent Based Modeling Basics](agent-based-modeling-basics-1.md) if you're new to ABM or if you want to better understand how these concepts translate into HASH.

You'll quickly find that the key to success in HASH is understanding and working with Agents and Behaviors. Start by playing with examples from our [HASH Index](https://hash.ai/index) or by reading on here and building upon the tools provided to you by the HASH platform.

 Continue on to  [Agent Based Modeling Basics](agent-based-modeling-basics-1.md) to see how modeling concepts map into HASH Core, and then to [Agents](anatomy-of-an-agent/) for the details on how to construct effective agent models.
