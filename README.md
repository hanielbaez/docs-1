# Overview

Welcome to [HASH](https://hash.ai), an end-to-end platform for quickly creating rich, massively parallelizable simulations.

## Getting Started

{% hint style="success" %}
As a new user, the best way to learn HASH is to browse our [gallery of examples](https://hash.ai/index/search?categoryID=5dc3da74cc0cf804dcc66a5c) to find toy simulations with interesting dynamics you can tinker with
{% endhint %}

Simulations in HASH might be a bit different than what you're used to. We leverage concepts from agent-based modeling - composable _agents_ and _behaviors,_ to make it faster and easier for you to study the complex dynamics of the problem you're trying to solve.

Read up on [Agent-Based Modeling Basics](agent-based-modeling-basics-1.md) if you're new to ABM, or if you want to better understand how these concepts translate into HASH.

You'll quickly find that the key to success in HASH is understanding and working with [Agents](anatomy-of-an-agent/) and [Behaviors](behaviors/).

Quickly get started by playing with examples from the [hIndex](https://hash.ai/index) or carry on reading to learn more about the tools provided to you by the HASH platform.
