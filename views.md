# Views

**HASH lets users access their simulation outputs in a variety of ways.** These include custom viewers for the 3D rendering, geospatial display, and charting/plotting of outputted simulation state.

Using the playbar at the bottom of the right-hand view pane you can scrub forwards and backwards in time through any existing simulation state.

## 3D

**Support for a full range of 3D models in Core's 3D viewer is coming soon.** In the meantime, the following primitives can be used to give form to agents: `box`, `cone`, `cylinder`, `dodecahedron` , `icosahedron`, `octahedron`, `plane`, `sphere`, `tetrahedron`, `torus`, `torusknot`

## Geospatial

## Plots

**Charts and plots are in many cases the best way to view simulation outputs in HASH.** As 

## Raw Output

The underlying JSON of any individual step is accessible from the 'Raw Output' tab
