# Experiments

Sometimes, you might be trying to find optimal values for a parameter in a simulation. You might change a value, rerun the simulation, check the output, run an analysis, and then change a value and repeat the process again. That's a tedious process that slows down your workflow.

HASH provides a way of doing this with just a few clicks. In the `experiments` tab of the simulation, you can easily specify a list of parameters to change the and the values that you want.
