# Libraries

## Python Packages

We run Python3 in the browser with the [Pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide) project, and we [currently support all of the packages that Pyodide does](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/tree/master/packages). That includes:

| Package | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/) | Graphs and networks |
| [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) | Data transformation and analysis |
| [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) | Machine Learning |
| [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) | Optimization, linear algebra, and statistics |
| [uncertainties](https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/index.html) | Numbers with uncertainties  |
