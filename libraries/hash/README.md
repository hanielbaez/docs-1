# HASH

There are a number of functions that are accessible through the built-in `hash_stdlib` . These are specifically designed to make frequent operations in HASH more streamlined. These libraries will be growing as we explore new ways to make it easier for you to build models in HASH. 

Currently, we have functions implemented in the following categories:

### [Spatial](spatial.md)

Functions that help with calculations for agent positioning and movement.

### [Neighbors](neighbors.md)

Functions that can help filter for neighbors in specific positions relative to the agent.

### [Statistics](javascript-libraries.md)

Functions to help calculate distributions and statistics.

### [Random](random.md)

Functions for generating random numbers.

### [Agent](agent.md)

Functions that help with creating or setting properties on agents.
