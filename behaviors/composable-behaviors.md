# Composable behaviors

**All user-authored behaviors, regardless of language, are** _**composable**_**.** This means they can be combined in any fashion with any number of others behaviors. Python and JavaScript behaviors can co-mingle and a single agent can be driven by behaviors programmed in multiple languages by a wide range of people.

**All user-authored behaviors can be shared on HASH Index.** Behaviors published in this way can be mapped to schemas for easy-discovery during the agent creation process, and downloaded by anybody with a HASH account.
